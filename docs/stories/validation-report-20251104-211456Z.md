## Summary
- Overall: 4/5 passed (80%)
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Previous Story Continuity
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)
✓ First story in epic; no predecessor continuity required. Evidence: sprint-status.yaml shows preceding item `epic-1` with status backlog, confirming no completed prior story.

### Source Document Coverage
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)
✓ Dev Notes cite epics, PRD, and architecture.md, the only available source documents. No tech spec, testing-strategy, or coding-standards files exist in docs/, so no missing citations.

### Acceptance Criteria Quality
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)
✓ Three ACs align with epic requirements and PRD guardrails, mapping directly to Story A1 bullet points. No invention detected.

### Task and AC Mapping
Pass Rate: 0/1 (0%)
⚠ Tasks capture required work streams but do not explicitly reference corresponding AC numbers; consider annotating each task with AC linkage to satisfy checklist guidance.

### Story Structure
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)
✓ Story includes drafted status, clear user story statement, initialized Dev Agent Record, and change log.

## Failed Items
( none )

## Partial Items
⚠ Tasks lack explicit AC references; add `(AC1)` style markers to reinforce traceability.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: None
2. Should Improve: Add AC cross-references to each task bullet so reviewers can trace coverage quickly.
3. Consider: Maintain citation formatting with section anchors in future iterations.
