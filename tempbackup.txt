## Executive Summary

The BMAD Demo NodeJS Project reimagines the admissions device roster as a responsive internal web app. It ingests the Google Sheet into MongoDB, wraps it in a premium, low-latency interface, and gives managers instant confidence in hardware assignments during demos by keeping the data live and governance-ready.

## 2. Core User Experience

### 2.1 Defining Experience

Managers compare device assignments, anonymize sensitive fields, and trigger sheet-to-UI refreshes without ever leaving a responsive web grid that feels as fluid as their favorite spreadsheet.

### 2.2 Novel UX Patterns

Live sync transparency banner, governance-friendly anonymization toggle, and audit-trail heartbeat indicator that pulses when a sync completes.
